<h1>The Forest Job</h1>

<h2> Presentation </h2>
As part of a school project, two colleagues and I created a job offers website named "The Forest Job." It's a full-stack website, and I primarily worked on the front-end part. The concept was to design a section for job seekers and another for companies. Job seekers can register and apply to multiple job offers provided by companies, while companies can register and publish several job offers. 

<h2> Tools and techologies used</h2>
 <h3> Front-end : React.js</h3>
 <h3> Back-end : Node.js & Express.js</h3>
 <h3> DataBase : MySql</h3>

<h2>How to run the website ?</h2>
First, download the folder "job_board". Then, go to the folder since your terminal and type :

```
npm run server
```


On other terminal, type :
```
npm run start
```

And go to the the follow link : http://localhost:3000/
